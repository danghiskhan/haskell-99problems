-- 01 Find the last element of a list.
--

myLast (x:xs) = myLast xs

--
-- 02 Find the last but one element of a list.
--

myButLast [] = error "No last but one for an empty list"
myButLast [x] = error "No last but one for a 1 element list"
myButLast [x,_] = x

--
-- 03 Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.
--

--
-- 04 Find the number of elements of a list.

--
-- 05 Reverse a list.

-- Inefficient

myReverse :: [a] -> [a]

        myReverse'' [] reversed = reversed
        myReverse'' (x:xs) reversed = myReverse'' xs (x:reversed)

--
-- 10 Run-length encoding of a list. 
-- Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. 
-- Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

--
-- 11 Modified run-length encoding.
-- Modify the result of problem 10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. 
-- Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.
--

--
-- 18 Extract a slice from a list.
-- Given two indices, i and k, the slice is the list containing the elements between the i'th and k'th element of the original list (both limits included). 
-- Start counting the elements with 1.
--

slice :: [a] -> Int -> Int -> [a]
slice xs i j = take (j + 1 - i) $ drop (i - 1) xs

--
-- 19 Rotate a list N places to the left.

-- 26 Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list
--
-- In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? 
-- We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). 
-- For pure mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities in a list.
